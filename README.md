Hello there! Vishal here. :v:

Quick glimpse of my career:
  - Working professional: Associate Consultant, Capgemini.
  - Ex Mercedes-Benz Research & Development India.
  - Sports-Biomechanics @ Hiroshima University, Japan.
  - B.E.(Hons.) Mechanical, BITS Pilani Goa, Goa, India 2018-2022.

Coming from a Core domain, I've delved into Biomechanics, Sports-Biomechanics and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) as part of my research.
So I've more or less kept myself occupied working with Python, MATLAB, SQL and MS Excel predominantly.
Owing to multi-tasking, I'm a Content Writer too! :writing_hand:

Here's what I love to do in my free time: Write Fiction & Short stories, Enjoy the Game of Cricket, and Travel like it's my last trip :airplane: .
